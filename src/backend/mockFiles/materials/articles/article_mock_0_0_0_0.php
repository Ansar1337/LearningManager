<h1>Kotlin advantages</h1>

<p>Kotlin is a modern but already mature programming language designed to make developers happier. It's concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.</p>
<br />
<p>Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications. It allows you to write concise and expressive code while maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology stacks, all with a smooth learning curve:</p>
<br />
<p>
    <div><b>Expressiveness:</b> Kotlin's innovative language features, such as its support for type-safe builders and delegated properties, help build powerful and easy-to-use abstractions.</div>
    <div><b>Scalability:</b> Kotlin's support for coroutines helps build server-side applications that scale to massive numbers of clients with modest hardware requirements.</div>
    <div><b>Interoperability:</b> Kotlin is fully compatible with all Java-based frameworks, so you can use your familiar technology stack while reaping the benefits of a more modern language.</div>
    <div><b>Migration:</b> Kotlin supports gradual migration of large codebases from Java to Kotlin. You can start writing new code in Kotlin while keeping older parts of your system in Java.</div>
    <div><b>Tooling:</b> In addition to great IDE support in general, Kotlin offers framework-specific tooling (for example, for Spring) in the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.</div>
    <div><b>Learning Curve:</b> For a Java developer, getting started with Kotlin is very easy. The automated Java-to-Kotlin converter included in the Kotlin plugin helps with the first steps. Kotlin Koans can guide you through the key features of the language with a series of interactive exercises.</div>
